               \n\nRxJS Primitives\nThis set of libraries provides some low-level RxJS operators for handling different operations with\nObservable values of primitive types (string, number, boolean, etc).\nThese operators use methods from ECMAScript built-in objects such as String and Number and it also includes some\nconvenience Boolean methods.\nThese are operators allow developers to avoid having to handle their own mapping or logic\nInstall Instructions\nTo include in your project install one or more of the libraries\n\nnpm i @tinynodes/rxjs-string @tinynodes/rxjs-number @tinynodes/rxjs-boolean @tinynodes/rxjs-utility\n\nLibraries\nrxjs-string\nAPI Documentation\nThis library provides operators around the ECMAScript String methods, taking an input Observable\nand returning a string or boolean output.\nrxjs-number\nAPI Documentation\nThis library provides operators around the ECMAScript Number methods, taking an input Observable\nand returning a number or boolean output\nrxjs-boolean\nAPI Documentation\nThis library provides handy methods where you are working with booleans, it takes any Observable value\nand returns results based on a boolean result\nrxjs-utility\nAPI Documentation\nA library that provides some additional useful operators such as startWithTap or debouceWithQuery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n
