# RxJS Primitives

This set of libraries provides some low-level [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) operators for handling different operations with
Observable values of primitive types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc).

These operators use methods from ECMAScript built-in objects such as `String` and `Number` and it also includes some
convenience `Boolean` methods.

These are operators allow developers to avoid having to handle their own mapping or logic.
